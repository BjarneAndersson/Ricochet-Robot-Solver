## About The Project

Hi everyone! After building an online multiplayer version of the board game <b>Ricochet Robots</b> I am now building an adequate solver.
In order to learn something new, I set my goal to build the whole application in Golang.

## Getting Started

1. Get a local copy
2. Create JSON file with board information (based on the template)
3. Select your file in the configuration file
4. Run the Golang application

## Usage

Solve any *Ricochet Robots Board* with the minimal number of moves required.


## Roadmap

My goals for the project are:
* Evaluate different solving algorithms
* Connect the solver to my online multiplayer version of the game
* Create an interactive website to display the solution and enable a more easy access to users

<u>Additionally:</u><br>
See the [open issues](https://github.com/BjarneAndersson/Ricochet-Robots-Solver/issues) for a list of proposed features (and
known issues).


## Contributing

Feedback, further ideas and contributions are **very welcome**.
